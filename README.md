I'm **xjmpereira**, just another engineer with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a master's in Automation.

- I'm a software engineer passionate about improving developers experience with tooling.
- I'm mostly experienced with *Python*, *Go*, and *Docker* for day-to-day tasks. I've had my fair share of infrastructure "coding" as well, mainly in Azure with *OpenTofu* and *Pulumi*.
- I also have some professional experience with *C++*, *Rust*, and *Nix* (though now I only work with these in my spare time for fun, especially *Nix*, as all my personal servers run *NixOS*)
- Currently exploring a bit of *zig*
- Fun fact, I have an untreated coffee addiction :sweat_smile:
