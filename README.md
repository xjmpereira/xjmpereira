I'm **xjmpereira**, just one more engineer with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a masters in Automation.

---

- I'm a software engineer who is passionate about improving developer experience with tooling.
- Mostly experienced with, python, golang, docker for the normal day to day. Have had my fair share of infrastructure "coding", mainly in Azure with terraform and pulumi. Also had professional experience with C++, Rust and Nix (now only work in these in my spare time for fun, specially nix since all my personal computers are NixOS) 
- Fun fact: I have a non treated coffee addiction :sweat_smile:
